# Intro to Programming Final---Portfolio Website

First, to start building a website, I created a Github repository, making sure to name it as myusername.github.io.I made sure to set the viewership to public.
Next, I created an html file in textmate and called it index.html. This would serve as my home page. 
To get more of an idea of what to do, I looked at the source code for [this page](https://rdwrome.github.io/). I also looked at the source code for [this website](https://www.joshuaredman.com/) and [this website](https://www.ambroseakinmusire.com/).

I wrote a head section of code to set up my website. For my next steps, I wanted to create pages for my website, as well as links to them on the home page. 
I first used the code on [this website](https://www.joshuaredman.com/)as a model to make the lengths to the other pages, but I realized that I needed to specify where the links the other pages are.
So, I ended up using a navigation menu instead. 

I found how to create a navigation menu from [this page](https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_lists_menu), and used the code from there in my own code.
Next, I created the other pages of the website by making a html file for each page.
