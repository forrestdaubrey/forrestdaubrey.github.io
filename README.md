# Intro to Programming Final---Portfolio Website

First, to start building a website, I created a Github repository, making sure to name it as myusername.github.io.I made sure to set the viewership to public.
Next, I created an html file in textmate and called it index.html. This would serve as my home page. 
To get more of an idea of what to do, I looked at the source code for [this page](https://rdwrome.github.io/). I also looked at the source code for [this website](https://www.joshuaredman.com/) and [this website](https://www.ambroseakinmusire.com/).

I wrote a head section of code to set up my website. In this section I also linked a styles.css file, which I used to style throughout the project. For my next steps, I wanted to create pages for my website, as well as links to them on the home page. 
I first used the code on [this website](https://www.joshuaredman.com/)as a model to make the links to the other pages, but I realized that I needed to change the location of the links on my page.
So, I ended up using a navigation menu instead. 

I found how to create a navigation menu from [this page](https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_lists_menu), and used the code from there in my own code.
Next, I created the other pages of the website by making a html file for each page.
I began adding content for each page, starting with the shows page by making up shows that I'll be playing soon. However, I chose to include real venues, and the real links to those venues' pages. 

The next page I added content to was the Contact page. I linked an email address of mine as a contact for questions. I also made a link for my instagram, but made the link the instagram icon.
I also added a copyright at the bottom of each page.

For the Bio page, I learned how to indent the first line of a paragraph, as well as how to create a container for text. I also added an image for the bio page, which I used the <img> tag for. I did the same for the image on my Home page, and made sure to use the right dimensions.

One thing that I continued to struggle with was trying to embed videos into my website. After getting pushed to the repository in Github, the videos I embeded wouldn't show up properly on the website, and wouldn't play. I tried embedding mp4 videos, ogg videos, and youtube videos using the <video> tag. When I open the html file, it plays just fine, but if I try to watch the videos from the website page in my browser, the vidoes don't show up. I did a great deal of research to try to amend this issue, but none of the methods succeeded at getting the videos played. Evnentually, I found that the videos wouldn't show up because HTML5 videos aren't supported on the browser I'm on, so I hope that on a different browser the videos may play.
	
Throughout the project I used the styles.css file to style the rest of the pages. I especially used the <div class> tag, and I changed fonts, font size, font color, and padding among other things to style the website how I liked.
